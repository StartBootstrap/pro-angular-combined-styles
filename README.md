# Start Bootstrap Pro Angular Combined Styles

This repo shows how to combine the sb-admin-pro-angular and sb-ui-kit-pro-angular styles into 1 project.

This is applicable to people who have purchased the [Pro Angular Bundle](https://startbootstrap.com/bundle/pro-angular-bundle) and want to create a combination marketing/admin website.

It is recommended that you create this structure inside of the sb-admin-pro-angular project as a starting point.

```bash
sb-admin-pro-angular/src/styles
```
